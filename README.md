### Singular Value Decomposition

This repository contains the codes and outputs of implementing Singular Value Decomposition from scratch and using the algorithm to compress images.
The images were first compressed in grayscale mode and the same method was extended to RGB matrices.

The repository contains the following:
1. **Code**: The [SVD_imageCompression.ipynb](https://github.com/aroshishp/SVD/blob/main/SVD_imageCompression.ipynb) notebook contains the following:
   * Theory of SVD and Applications
   * Implementation of SVD from scratch and verifying by remultiplying
   * Comparison with the in-built SVD function provided by NumPy's Linear Algebra library
   * Image Compression and Quality Enhancement in grayscale
   * Extension of above to RGB
   * The images used are [quality.jpeg](https://github.com/aroshishp/SVD/blob/main/quality.jpeg), [quality1.
   * Report on findings
2. **Report**: The [Epoch_Session_1_Report.pdf](https://github.com/aroshishp/SVD/blob/main/Epoch_Session_1_Report.pdf) is the overall report for this hackathon.
   The [Epoch_Session_1_LR.pdf](https://github.com/aroshishp/SVD/blob/main/Epoch_Session_1_LR.pdf) is my learning report before and after session 1.
3. **Interactive Tool**:
